A navigation app that is able to use within Monash University Sunway Campus premises to guide the user to their preferred destination via a series of walking directions. The app will direct the user along paths comprising of ordered lists of geographical locations (represented as latitudes and longitudes) where the user must change direction. Then it will monitor the userâ€™s location and give them directions to the next location on the path, noting when they reach it and directing them to the subsequent location until they reach the destination.

This is a proof of concept for a mobile app based navigation which can be further improved for the use of visually impaired people or patients within a hospital premises.

#### Creating a new path

One of the novel features of the app would be the ability to create your own path and save it by one tap.
